## UX Design

---

The Line Planner site was designed around User Experience Design 
Principles. Target users were identified and business and user 
goals were defined. A minimum viable product was determined that 
could achieve these goals. Future development potential was also 
mapped out. The scope was set to ensure the project remained 
concise and fit the strategy, and the structure reflected this 
scope whilst identifying the various APIs and technologies that 
would be used in the initial site version, as well potential future 
expansion. The skeleton of the site was defined using wireframe models, which assisted in making key design decisions and targets prior to commencing site construction, including site responsiveness considerations. Surface design was considered to identify suitable look and feel for this site, which is aimed at a mainly professional audience.
